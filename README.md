# Shakespeare_in_Shiny
Three of Shakespeare's works are visualized in R-Shiny. For each one, a wordcloud and a word count bar chart is generated, with user-customizable parameters for each.

You can access the app [here](https://svavila2.shinyapps.io/problem-set-3-vavilala/).

## How to recreate the application
1. Download the Shakespeare_Shiny_App folder
2. Open the R .proj file
3. Run the app.R file
